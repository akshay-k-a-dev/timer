# ‚è± Stopwatch Timer Project

Welcome to **Stopwatch Timer**, the most exciting thing since... well, actual clocks! üéâ

## Project Description

This simple, yet life-changing stopwatch timer project was made using the magical trio of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Why? Because how else would you know how long you‚Äôve spent procrastinating? This app will keep track of every second you waste ‚Äî err, *spend* productively.

## Project Purpose

Created with love (and a bit of caffeine) for the **ED Club Orientation Program** by the wonderful folks at **IEDC, MAMO College**. Because nothing says "we're serious about innovation" like an online stopwatch. ‚è∞‚ú®

## Creator

Built by the *master of time* himself, **[Asheed EliyanGOD](https://github.com/AsheedEliyangod)**, the guy who probably wished for more hours in a day, but settled for coding this instead.
